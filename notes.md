# Project Proposal

A website that allows users to fetch random artworks, and see them loaded on a random wall.

## MVP
- A user can load the web page and see an artwork on a wall on load.
- A user can click a button to load a new artwork and new background.

## Stretch
- The random artwork is framed with a slight shadow.
